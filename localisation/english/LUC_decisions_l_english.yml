 LUC_Fascist_Radicalisation_cat_desc:0 "While not a single political party, the §FMilitary Movement§! - represented by the §Y[ROOT.GetFascistParty]§! at the political level - is a loose collection of paramilitaries, politicians and businessmen seeking to align [ROOT.GetNameDef] with other ultranationalist movements in Europe, Germany in particular. Having failed to secure an electoral mandate per their ban, they may seek to instead overthrow the government - either by subversion or outright violence."

 LUC_Government_LandtagSupport_cat:0 "Political Support"
 LUC_Government_LandtagSupport_cat_desc:0 "The [ROOT.GetAdjective] political system is imperfect. Nominally a constitutionally monarchy, in reality the majority of the political power is usually deligated to the §YPrime Minister§!. The §YPrince§! of [ROOT.GetNameDef] on the other hand serves as a head of state. However, the §YLandtag§! - regrouping various parties - and the broader government at larger - has been vested with the power to recommend that the prime minister be deposed, which would serve as a de facto vote of no confidence.\n\nThe government of [ROOT.GetNameDef] is therefore one which has traditionally replied on compromise, coalition and political negotiating. Should the §CLandtag Support§! fall too low, then there is a risk that our current §YPrime Minister§! be §Rforced to resign§!. As such, it becomes imperative that we court and appease the different §Yfactions§! making up our government - lest the government collapse.\n"
