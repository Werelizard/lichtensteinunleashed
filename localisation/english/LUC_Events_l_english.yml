 LUC_Fascists.desc:0 "Though Liechtenstein has - mostly - steered clear of the growing radicalisation and societal polarisation of many of its European neighbours, it is a barely concealed fact that many in Liechtensteiner government, police force and even amongst the Landtag have great admiration for Germany's government and ultranationalistic policies, seeing these as the best bulwark against both liberalism and communism.\n\nWhilst not necessarily outright disloyal to the Prince or even the state itself, these individuals' radical ideas and desire to see ourselves align with Germany are seen by our government as a threat to our stability and even our independence."
