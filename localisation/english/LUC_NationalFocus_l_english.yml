 # Liechtensteiner Economy
 LUC_EconomyStateOfEconomy_Focus:0 "Revitalise the Economy"
 LUC_EconomyStateOfEconomy_Focus_desc:0 "The Liechtensteiner Economy, has hardly evolved past artisans and farmers - with the overwhelming majority of its exports being agricultural in nature. The industrial capability of the country is near to non-existant and will need a near to complete overhaul if our country is to succesfully transition into the twentieth century."

 LUC_EconomyDevelopVaduz_Focus:0 "Develop Vaduz"
 LUC_EconomyDevelopVaduz_Focus_desc:0 "The city of Vaduz is barely industrialised as is. We should endeavour to continue developing it, so that it may be a worthy rival to other Alpine and Southern German cities - if not in terms of size then in terms of infrastructure and inudstrial scale."

 LUC_EconomyIntegrateBank_Focus_desc:0 "The Bank of Liechtenstein Aktiengesellschaft has, since the financial crisis of the 1930's, slipped under the thumb of the Prince of Liechtenstein.

Perhaps it would be better to twist their hand and secure their loyalty - ensuring that such consequential assets do not slip between our fingers, and that we do not lose control of vast monetary reserves."

 LUC_EconomySecureForeignInvestments_Focus:0 "Attract Foreign Investments"
 LUC_EconomySecureForeignInvestments_Focus_desc:0 "Liechtenstein is a neutral nation, like its neighbour Switzerland. By following its example, our government would strive to secure economical investments and ties with major European banks - irrespectively of their political dispositions."
 LUC_EconomySecureForeignInvestments_Focus_tt:0 "For every country in §YCentral Europe§! and §YWestern Europe§!

 LUC_EconomyModernTools_Focus:0 "Purchase Modern Tools"
 LUC_EconomyModernTools_Focus_desc:0 "Farming equipment, hammers and the odd blowtorch will not be enough. We need to acquire modern equipment from neighbouring countries if we wish to have a chance to develop our industry."

 LUC_EconomyIron_Focus:0 "Expand the Gonzen Iron Mine"
 LUC_EconomyIron_Focus_desc:0 "Whilst the Vaduz valley is no industrial cradle, the soil upon which our country rests is rich with both iron and aluminium ore, riches begging to be carved out of their earthen prison."
