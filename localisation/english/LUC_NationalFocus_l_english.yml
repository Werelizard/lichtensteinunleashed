 # Liechtensteiner Economy
 LUC_EconomyStateOfEconomy_Focus:0 "Revitalise the Economy"
 LUC_EconomyStateOfEconomy_Focus_desc:0 "The Liechtensteiner Economy, has hardly evolved past artisans and farmers - with the overwhelming majority of its exports being agricultural in nature. The industrial capability of the country is near to non-existant and will need a near to complete overhaul if our country is to succesfully transition into the twentieth century."

 LUC_EconomyDevelopVaduz_Focus:0 "Develop Vaduz"
 LUC_EconomyDevelopVaduz_Focus_desc:0 "The city of Vaduz is barely industrialised as is. We should endeavour to continue developing it, so that it may be a worthy rival to other Alpine and Southern German cities - if not in terms of size then in terms of infrastructure and inudstrial scale."

 LUC_EconomyIntegrateBank_Focus:0 "Integrate the Aktiengesellschaft"
 LUC_EconomyIntegrateBank_Focus_desc:0 "The Bank of Liechtenstein Aktiengesellschaft has, since the financial crisis of the 1930's, slipped under the thumb of the Prince of Liechtenstein. However our control remains...limited. Perhaps it would be better to twist their hand and secure their loyalty - ensuring that such consequential assets do not slip between our fingers, and that we do not lose control of vast monetary reserves."

 LUC_EconomyRoyalAssets_Focus:0 "Repatriate Princely Assets"
 LUC_EconomyRoyalAssets_Focus_desc:0 "The Princely family of Liechtenstein owns numerous estates, assets and properties throughout Bohemia, Germany and Austria. It is time for us to re-assert our control of what is rightfully the crown's property."

 LUC_EconomySecureForeignInvestments_Focus:0 "Attract Foreign Investments"
 LUC_EconomySecureForeignInvestments_Focus_desc:0 "Liechtenstein is a neutral nation, like its neighbour Switzerland. By following its example, our government would strive to secure economical investments and ties with major European banks - irrespectively of their political dispositions."

 LUC_EconomyHydroEnergy_Focus:0 "Expand the Lawena Power Station"
 LUC_EconomyHydroEnergy_Focus_desc:0 "The Vaduz valley sits by the Rhine, something which begs to be exploited. By expanding the current hydroelectric infrastructure, we ensure nation-wide access to cheap, renewable and most importantly independent energy."

 LUC_EconomyBroadElectrification_Focus:0 "Broad Electrification"
 LUC_EconomyBroadElectrification_Focus_desc:0 "Our cities, villages and towns darken at night when they should be lit as the night sky above. Only through the broad electrification can this goal be achieved. Only by ensuring that every house, every factory and every government building has access to electricity can we become a modern nation."

 LUC_EconomyOpenTractorFactories_Focus:0 "Open the 'Tractor Factories'"
 LUC_EconomyOpenTractorFactories_Focus_desc:0 "Tractors are important not just to our farmers, but to our economy as a whole; a burgeoning tractor industry will open further trade avenues, as well as continue developing the mechanical, automotive and industrial sectors of our economy."

 LUC_EconomyPrecisionExports_Focus:0 "Clockwork of Our Own"
 LUC_EconomyPrecisionExports_Focus_desc:0 "We've been approached by both Swiss watch and part makers, who have sought out our endorsment in the construction of factories in Vaduz, with the aim to produce specialised tools and gears."

 LUC_EconomyUrbanisation_Focus:0 "Urbanise the Villages"
 LUC_EconomyUrbanisation_Focus_desc:0 "Our infrastructure remains trapped in the past - a vestige of the world past. This needs to be adressed."

 LUC_EconomyModernTools_Focus:0 "Purchase Modern Tools"
 LUC_EconomyModernTools_Focus_desc:0 "Farming equipment, hammers and the odd blowtorch will not be enough. We need to acquire modern equipment from neighbouring countries if we wish to have a chance to develop our industry."

 LUC_EconomyIron_Focus:0 "Expand the Gonzen Iron Mine"
 LUC_EconomyIron_Focus_desc:0 "Whilst the Vaduz valley is no industrial cradle, the soil upon which our country rests is rich with both iron and aluminium ore, riches begging to be carved out of their earthen prison."
